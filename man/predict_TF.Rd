\usage{
predict_TF(
  datasets = c("hTFtarget", "KnockTF", "FIMO_JASPAR", "PWMEnrich_JASPAR", "ENCODE",
    "CHEA", "TRRUST", "GTRD", "ChIP_Atlas"),
  target = "GAPDH",

  GTEx_tissue = "Colon",
  cor_DB = c("TCGA", "GTEx"),
  cor_cutoff = 0.3,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasets}{Including the TF-target regulatory data of 7 public TF online tools and the TF-targets prediction results analyzed by using FIMO and PWMEnrich.}

\item{target}{Input a gene symbol, e.g. GAPDH.}

\item{TCGA_tissue}{Cancer type in TCGA database, you can use tissue_type("TCGA") to abtain the tissue types.}

\item{GTEx_tissue}{Cancer type in GTEx database, you can use tissue_type("GTEx") to abtain the tissue types.}

\item{cor_DB}{The database used for the correlation analyze between TF and targets. You can use 2 databases, viz. TCGA (33 cancer types) and GTEx (31 normal tissue types).}

\item{cor_cutoff}{Threshold of correlation coefficient for correlation analysis.}

\item{FIMO.score}{Threshold of the score of the prediction TF-target results by using FIMO algorithm (bigger is better), default 10.}

\item{PWMEnrich.p}{Threshold of the score of the prediction TF-target results by using PWMEnrich algorithm (smaller is better), default 0.10.}

\item{cut.log2FC}{Threshold of log2FC for KnockTF dataset, default 1.}

\item{down.only}{Logic value. If true, only the downregulated genes in TF knockout/knockdown cells were returned in KnockTF dataset.}

\item{app}{Logic value. TRUE only used in the shiny app.}
